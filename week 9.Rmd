## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r}
typeof(c("John", "Mary"))
typeof(c(2, 3.1412))
typeof(c(TRUE, TRUE, F))
```
**class** is a catergorisation method that categorises different values based on **what we can do with those values**
*type: man and woman
*class: differdnce based on skills.(plumber class,teacher class)
***

```{r}
# date time information
dateTimeInfo <- "2021-01-01 12:03:33"
typeof(dateTimeInfo)
```

```{r}
dateTimeInfo + 20
# character class value + 20
```

 we can choose proper parsing function to teach R understand a date time value is more than a character--teaching R understand a class called date/time.
 
```{r}
dateTimeInfo2 <- lubridate::ymd_hms("2021-01-01 12:03:33") 
class(dateTimeInfo2)
```
  * luberidate::ymd_hms is a parsing function to teach R understand date time
 
 
 ```{r}
 dateTimeInfo2 + lubridate::seconds(20)
 ```
type: how we store **raw** information
class: what we (R) can do with different informations
